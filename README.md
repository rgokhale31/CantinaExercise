# Cantina Exercise

Hi there! This is my submission for the Cantina Code Exercise. First, sure that you are in the same directory as CantinaExercise.py and SystemViewController.json. 

To run the program itself, type the command "python CantinaExercise.py" into the command line (i.e terminal). 

Objective: This program parses a JSON file and allows users to observe specific types of data by typing specific selector commands, such as "class" or "classNames".
