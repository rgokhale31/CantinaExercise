# JSON ClassName parser

First, make sure that you are in the same directory as parser.py and SystemViewController.json. 

To run the program itself, type the command "python parser.py" into the command line (i.e terminal). 

Objective: This program parses a JSON file and allows users to observe specific types of data by typing specific selector commands, such as "class" or "classNames".
